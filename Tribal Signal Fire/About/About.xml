	<description>Tribal colonies were never able to communicate with other factions in the game so this mod will allow you to do just that.

The SignalFire is built, looks and requires to be refuled just like the campfire but pawns can interact with it as though it is a comms console. You cannot communicate with orbital trade ships, just ground factions.
